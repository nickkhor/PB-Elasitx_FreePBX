# PB-Elasitx_FreePBX
Was facing some problem in workplace where having a lot of extension number and user have no idea where and how to get latest list.
Multiple model of SIP Phone in place but can't sync from SIP server.
Then i found out this https://ethertubes.com/grandstream-phone-book-creator-for-elastix/

Script is nice, copy & paste in html directory, it will just work without extra effort (thanks Ethertubes).

So i wanted to make more effort on it, re-write the php and suit my need.

Also share here for easier future reference :P

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tested on Elastix 2.5, freePBX	2.11, PHP 5.1.6,  CentOS.

Current designed for:
1. MicroSIP Softphone
2. Yealink Dect/Normal Phone
